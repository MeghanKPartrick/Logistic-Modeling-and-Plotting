<h1>Logistic Modeling and Plotting Curves</h1>

<h2>Dataset Description</h2>
We perform a field experiment to measure racial discrimination in the labor market. We respond with fictitious resumes to help-wanted ads in Boston and Chicago newspapers. To manipulate perception of race, each resume is randomly assigned either a very African American sounding name or a very White sounding name. The results show significant discrimination against African-American names: White names receive 50 percent more callbacks for interviews. We also find that race affects the benefits of a better resume. For White names, a higher quality resume elicits 30 percent more callbacks whereas for African Americans, it elicits a far smaller increase. Applicants living in better neighborhoods receive more callbacks but, interestingly, this effect does not differ by race. The amount of discrimination is uniform across occupations and industries. Federal contractors and employers who list “Equal Opportunity Employer” in their ad discriminate as much as other employers. We find little evidence that our results are driven by employers inferring something other than race, such as social class, from the names. These results suggest that racial discrimination is still a prominent feature of the labor market.

<h2>Project Description</h2>
In this project, I construct foundational logistic models, while employing advanced visualization techniques such as the jitter function and a custom-crafted logit function. The inclusion of empirical logit plots and calculated predictions serves to deepen our comprehension. I also divide the data into subsets dependent on race and gender in order to create visuals that not only elucidate patterns within specific demographic categories but also contribute to a more profound understanding of the underlying dynamics of the dataset
